## Installation
*Lauscher* uses the [SoundFile](https://pysoundfile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package for parsing audio data.
On Linux, this library requires you to install `libsndfile` via your distribution's package manager, e.g. via `apt install libsndfile1`.

We recommend setting up a [virtualenv](https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv) (you'll need `apt install python3-venv` or similar) for your *lauscher* project:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/electronicvisions/lauscher.git
cd lauscher
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Assuming you are working in a private copy of *lauscher* that has been installed as noted above, you can continue by calculating a first spiketrain from one of the included examples:
```shell
python -m lauscher test/resources/spoken_digit.flac my_first_spiketrain.npz --num_channels 70 --verbose
```
Note that due to the complexity of the implemented model, even short audio files might take multiple minutes to convert.
Memory consumption might be huge for long audio files.
